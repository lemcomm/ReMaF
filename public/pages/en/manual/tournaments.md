For years have First Ones declared themselves of noble blood and excellent lineage. Soon, you'll be able to prove that worth.

Tournaments exist in several categories, ranging from "Grand Tournaments" to "Free for All Arena Fights", they allow you to finally, with relative safety, decide who is the best.

Initially, these will be single-elimination, but double-elimination is planned.

Single elimination requires at least two participants, while double elimination requires four. Participants will earn [Accolades](accolades) detailing how they placed in each tournament they competed in.

Arena Fights
------------
These are fairly straight forward competitions where you either compete against opponents using the same weapons or using whichever weapon the combatant prefers. Unlike duels, the Gods have declared that all fights shall be done solely on foot with the weapon of choice of the weapon of the fight. No shields, no mounts, just skill.

These are either conducted in mass fights with everyone fighting everyone, team fights where a group fights one or more other groups, until eliminating all other teams, or mixed where combatants start in groups but fight the final round(s) solo.

Organizers can determine the specifics of these, down to limiting weapons, or doing one vs one fights.

Races
------------
Mounted races allow you to demonstrate your riding capabilities, with the main determining factor being number of laps. We recommend at least five, but you can go far higher or as few as one. Unlike Arena Fights, these will be up to eight participants per race, with at least two rounds of competition to determine a winner. These are almost always determined purely by horseback skill, though some luck can be involved.

Jousts
----------
Two combatants, one victor. Primarily determined based on horseback and lance skills, though some luck can be involved.

Archery
-------
While arena fights may have you use your bows against others, archery tournaments test your skill against static targets.

Grand Tournaments
-----------------
Wish to hold more than one type of tournament? Host a "Grand Tournament". These tournaments contain the full list of competitions, not only awarding champion status to the winners of those, but also to the overall winner.
