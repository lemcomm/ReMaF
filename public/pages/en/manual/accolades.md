### This manual page is detailing a highly experimental and incomplete feature that is in the process of being implemented. Everything on this page, while as detailed as it may be, is subject to change. ###

Character achievements count how many times you've done something, Positions tell you what heights you reached, and Artifacts tell you of the things you found. Your history will tell you the things you did, but so many things can be lost over the years.

This is where Accolades show up. Accolades are the great victories, harrowing defeats, first-ever moments, and championships you won. These are the things that would be common knowledge about you to some people outside your family. Things like winning tournaments, killing a dragon, finding an artifact, or restoring a realm.

Outside of you though, these are things your countrymen will know you for, things the realm will take pride in, maybe even things your soldiers did under your command.

Some, will be things noted by the Gods, while others will be things noted by your realm, like it's highest honors.
